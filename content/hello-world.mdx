Hi there!


Embarking on a software engineering degree is a thrilling adventure filled with coding challenges, sleepless nights, and moments of eureka. Here's a glimpse into my journey through the first two years of my software engineering degree.

## Year 1: Foundations and Fundamentals

### Semester 1: Diving into the Basics

The first semester was all about laying the groundwork. We started with introductory courses in programming, mathematics, and computer science principles. I vividly remember my first programming class, where we learned the basics of Python.

```python
print("Hello World")
```


### Semester 2: Building on the Basics

In the second semester, we moved on to more complex topics. Data structures and algorithms became a significant part of our curriculum. Learning about arrays, linked lists, and sorting algorithms was both challenging and rewarding.


Understanding these concepts was crucial as they form the backbone of efficient programming. We also had our first brush with databases, learning SQL and the basics of database management.

## Year 2: Expanding Horizons

### Semester 1: Stepping into Software Development

The third semester introduced us to software development methodologies and practices. Agile, Scrum, and version control systems like Git became part of our daily vocabulary. Working on group projects taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

We also delved deeper into object-oriented programming (OOP) with Java. The concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism were fascinating to explore.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

### Semester 2: Exploring Advanced Topics

The fourth semester was packed with advanced topics. We learned about operating systems, computer networks, and web development. Creating a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was one of the highlights.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Another exciting aspect was learning about software testing and quality assurance. Understanding the importance of writing clean, maintainable code and testing it thoroughly was a game-changer.

```python
def test_bubble_sort():
    assert bubble_sort([3, 2, 1]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert bubble_sort([5, 3, 8, 4, 2]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

test_bubble_sort()
```

## Looking Ahead

As I move into the third year of my degree, I'm excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. The first two years have equipped me with a solid foundation in software engineering principles and practices. I look forward to diving deeper into specialized fields, working on more complex projects, and continuing to grow as a software engineer.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey!
